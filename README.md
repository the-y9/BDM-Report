# BSMS2001P - Business Data Management Capstone Project

## Project Title
**Data-Driven Optimization for B2B HVAC&R Operations**

## Course Overview
The Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project is a part of the [BSMS2001P Diploma Level Course at IIT Madras](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSMS2001P.html). This independent research project requires students to engage with a business firm to identify and analyze data-related challenges. Students will collect, clean, and analyze primary data, and provide actionable insights to improve decision-making processes. Projects can be conducted with firms from either organized sectors (e.g., manufacturing, IT, automobile) or unorganized sectors (e.g., Kirana stores, vegetable vendors).

## Project Description
This project focuses on optimizing Business-to-Business (B2B) operations within the Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVAC&R) industry using data-driven approaches. The goal is to identify inefficiencies and propose improvements based on thorough data analysis.

### Objectives
- **Identify Issues:** Reach out to Blue Star, a leading firm in the HVAC&R sector, to understand the challenges they face in their B2B operations.
- **Data Collection:** Gather primary data related to these challenges.
- **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the data for analysis by addressing any inconsistencies or errors.
- **Data Analysis:** Use statistical and analytical methods to derive insights from the cleaned data.
- **Insight Generation:** Provide valuable recommendations to optimize B2B operations for Blue Star.

## Acknowledgments
